    "Legos have been a staple in children’s entertainment for decades and continue to thrive in today’s climate with hundreds of thousands of children actively enjoying this renowned product. Developed from a wooden toy in the 1930s, The Lego Group is now estimated to be worth over 11 billion dollars, with hundreds of different products readily available. While many have come and gone with their own replicas, Lego has truly skyrocketed to become one of its own in the toy industry. Consumers can buy Legos by set, which all contain a variety of pieces of different shapes and sizes that all fit together. These sets have many different themes, including partnerships with entertainment franchises such as Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Harry Potter."
